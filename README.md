Bubble Sort : This program takes as its input 8 user inputted numbers and uses a bubble sort to sort them in ascending order. This bubble sort works by comparing adjacent numbers and swapping them if the left value is less than the right value, until all numbers are in ascending order. It then outputs the sorted list of numbers.
